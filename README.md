# Student-Score-Manager
This is a Student Score Management System built using Python's tkinter library. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing students, subjects, and their scores. It is organized into three main tabs:

Student Management:

Allows users to register students and subjects.
Includes input fields for student and subject names, with buttons to save the data.
Score Management:

Enables users to add scores for students in specific subjects.
Includes functionality to view all recorded scores.
Statistics & Visualization:

Provides tools to calculate statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for a subject.
Allows users to visualize scores for a subject and view available subjects.
The application uses a tabbed interface for better organization, a status bar for feedback, and tooltips for user guidance. It integrates with a database via StudentManager and ScoreManager modules to store and retrieve data.
